        <h1 id="bioLabel">William James Linstead, Animal Enjoyer & Computer Addict</h1>
        <p id="bio">I am a beginner computer programmer, studying computer programming and analysis at georgian
          college.  I enjoy the development of software, as well as the design of websites, such as this one.
          While I do enjoy developing and styling websites and applications, I also am an enjoyer of my furry
          companions.  When I am not typing away at a keyboard to create software applications, I would be at home 
          enjoying the partnership of my pets, such as right now where my cat is currently sleeping on my desk.  
        </p>
        <p id="bio2">I have experience with multiple different programming languages, such as python, CSS, and Java
          During my time at georgian I have been given the chance to get  knowledge on a wide variety of languages
